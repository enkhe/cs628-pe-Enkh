      "instructions": "1. In a bowl, combine flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Toss the beef slices in this mixture until lightly coated.\n\n2. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and the oil over high heat. Once hot, add the beef in a single layer (work in batches if necessary) and quickly sear on both sides until browned but not fully cooked, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate.\n\n3. In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of butter. Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the beef.\n\n4. Add the remaining butter to the skillet. Add onions and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.\n\n5. Pour in beef broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer.\n\n6. Stir in Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Return to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes until slightly reduced.\n\n7. Meanwhile, cook egg noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.\n\n8. Reduce heat to low and stir in sour cream until well incorporated.\n\n9. Return beef and mushrooms to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes until beef is cooked through and sauce is thickened. Be careful not to boil after adding the sour cream as it may curdle.\n\n10. Serve over egg noodles and garnish with fresh parsley.",
      "notes": "For the most tender result, slice the beef against the grain and make sure the pan is very hot before searing. The sauce can be made in advance up to the point of adding the sour cream. When ready to serve, reheat gently and then add the sour cream. Traditional Russian Stroganoff uses a small amount of tomato paste, which you can add with the broth if desired."

      "instructions": "1. In a large bowl, mix the sourdough starter with warm water until dissolved.\n\n2. Add the flour and mix until you have a shaggy dough with no dry flour remaining.\n\n3. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes (autolyse phase).\n\n4. Add the salt and incorporate it by pinching and folding the dough.\n\n5. Begin the bulk fermentation: perform a series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. Simply grab one side of the dough, stretch it up, and fold it over to the other side. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat for all four sides.\n\n6. Let the dough rise at room temperature (around 75°F/24°C) for another 2-4 hours until it has increased in volume by about 50% and shows bubbles on the surface.\n\n7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Shape it into a round by pulling the edges into the center to create tension on the surface.\n\n8. Let it rest for 15 minutes, then shape it again into a tight boule or batard shape.\n\n9. Transfer the dough, seam-side up, to a floured banneton or a bowl lined with a floured kitchen towel.\n\n10. Cover and refrigerate for 12-15 hours (cold fermentation).\n\n11. Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) with a Dutch oven inside for at least 45 minutes.\n\n12. Turn the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper, score the top with a sharp knife or razor blade.\n\n13. Carefully place the dough with the parchment into the hot Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 20 minutes.\n\n14. Reduce the temperature to 450°F (230°C), remove the lid, and bake for another 20-25 minutes until the crust is deep golden brown.\n\n15. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely for at least 2 hours before slicing.",
      "notes": "The key to great sourdough is patience and maintaining a healthy starter. The long fermentation develops flavor and creates the characteristic open crumb. For best results, use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients by weight. The bread keeps well for 4-5 days stored in a paper bag or wrapped in a cloth."

Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes until they begin to soften and turn translucent.\n\n3. Sprinkle with sugar (helps caramelization) and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the onions for about 40-50 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until they are deeply caramelized and a rich golden-brown color.\n\n4. Add flour to the caramelized onions and stir continuously for about 2-3 minutes to cook the flour.\n\n5. Gradually add the beef stock while stirring, then add the white wine, bay leaf, and thyme.\n\n6. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer gently for about 30 minutes, allowing the soup to thicken slightly and the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n7. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. Place baguette slices on a baking sheet and toast under the broiler until golden brown on both sides, about 1-2 minutes per side.\n\n8. Ladle the soup into oven-safe bowls. Place the bowls on a baking sheet.\n\n9. Float 1-2 toasted baguette slices on top of each bowl of soup, then sprinkle generously with grated Gruyère cheese.\n\n10.

      "notes": "The secret to exceptional French onion soup is patience during the caramelization process—properly caramelized onions should take at least 40 minutes.

For the best flavor, use homemade beef stock if possible."

The steaks can remain in the bath for up to 4 hours without any degradation in quality.\n\n7. About 15 minutes before serving, prepare for searing. Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until smoking hot.\n\n8. Remove the steaks from the bags and pat them completely dry with paper towels. This is crucial for a good sear.\n\n9.

In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the lobster shells and bodies, crushing them slightly with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes until the shells turn a deeper red.\n\n4. Add carrots, celery, onion, shallots, and garlic to the pot. Sauté for 5 minutes until vegetables begin to soften.\n\n5. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\n\n6.

Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered, for 45 minutes.\n\n9. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, pressing on the solids to extract all the flavor. Discard the solids.\n\n10.

      "notes": "This Michelin-inspired lobster bisque relies on extracting maximum flavor from the lobster shells. For an even more luxurious presentation, reserve one of the claw pieces whole for garnish. The bisque can be made a day ahead (without adding the lobster meat) and gently reheated before serving. A splash of sherry can be added just before serving for an additional layer of flavor."

Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (it will be slightly sticky).\n\n5. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.\n\n6.

      "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.\n\n3. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 2-3 minutes.\n\n4. Add vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n\n5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix.\n\n6. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts (if using) with a wooden spoon or spatula.\n\n7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.\n\n8. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown around the edges but still soft in the center.\n\n9. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.\n\n10. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.",
      "notes": "For chewier cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar. For a softer texture, add an extra egg yolk. Chilling the dough for at least 30 minutes (or up to 72 hours) before baking will enhance flavor and prevent spreading. For an extra touch, sprinkle a little flaky sea salt on top just before baking."
