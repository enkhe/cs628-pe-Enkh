      "instructions": "1. Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper, cooking until softened, about 5 minutes.\n\n2. Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne. Cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n3. Pour in the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well and let simmer for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.\n\n4. Using a spoon, make 6 indentations in the sauce. Carefully crack an egg into each indentation.\n\n5. Cover the skillet and cook for about 5-8 minutes, or until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still runny (or cook longer if you prefer firmer yolks).\n\n6. Sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese, parsley, and cilantro.\n\n7. Serve hot directly from the skillet with crusty bread for dipping into the sauce and eggs.",
      "notes": "Shakshuka originated in North Africa and is now popular throughout the Middle East. It's perfect for breakfast, brunch, or dinner. Add other vegetables like zucchini or spinach for extra nutrition. Spice it up with harissa paste or chili flakes if you prefer it hotter. The dish keeps well and often tastes even better the next day.",

      "instructions": "1. Drain the soaked chickpeas thoroughly. They should have doubled in size but will still be raw and hard.\n\n2. Place chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Pulse until you have a coarse meal consistency, not a smooth paste. Scrape down the sides as needed.\n\n3. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add baking powder and flour, mixing well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to overnight).\n\n4. Test the mixture by forming a small ball with wet hands. If it holds together well, it's ready. If it's too crumbly, add a bit more flour.\n\n5. With wet hands, form the mixture into balls about the size of ping pong balls, or use a falafel scoop. Slightly flatten them.\n\n6. Heat oil in a deep pot to 350째F (175째C). Fry falafels in batches, turning occasionally, until deep golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes.\n\n7. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.\n\n8. Serve hot in pita bread with tahini sauce, diced cucumber, tomato, and red onion.",
      "notes": "The key to perfect falafel is using dried chickpeas soaked overnight, not canned. Canned chickpeas are too soft and will make your falafel fall apart during frying. For a healthier version, you can bake the falafel at 375째F (190째C) for about 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through. Falafel freezes well, so make a large batch and freeze uncooked patties for quick meals later.",
