Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n\n6. Serve immediately at room temperature.",
      "notes": "Caprese salad is best made with high-quality, in-season tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. For the best flavor, allow the cheese and tomatoes to come to room temperature before serving. If you don't have balsamic glaze, you can reduce regular balsamic vinegar by simmering it until thickened. This simple salad highlights the flavors of its few ingredients, so use the best quality you can find.",

Remove mushrooms, chop finely, and strain the soaking liquid through a fine sieve, reserving the liquid.\n\n2. Clean and slice fresh mushrooms. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add fresh mushrooms and sauté until golden and their moisture has evaporated, about 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, add thyme, and set aside.\n\n3. In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the remaining olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat.

Stir in parsley and adjust seasoning if needed.\n\n11. Serve immediately, topped with remaining Parmesan and a drizzle of truffle oil if using.",
      "notes": "Italian risotto requires constant attention and stirring to release the starch that creates its signature creamy texture. The rice should be cooked al dente, with a slight bite in the center. For an elegant presentation, garnish with a few sautéed mushroom slices and fresh thyme sprigs. For extra luxury, use a mixture of wild mushrooms when in season.",

      "instructions": "1. Place dried porcini mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak for 20 minutes. Once soft, remove mushrooms, finely chop them, and strain the soaking liquid through a fine sieve to remove any grit. Reserve both the mushrooms and liquid.\n\n2. In a large, wide saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the fresh mushrooms and cook until golden brown and their liquid has evaporated, about 8-10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove two-thirds of the mushrooms and set aside.\n\n3. In the same pan, add the remaining olive oil. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Add the rice and stir to coat with oil, toasting it for about 2 minutes until the edges become translucent.\n\n5. Pour in the wine and stir until almost completely absorbed.\n\n6. Add the chopped porcini mushrooms and a ladleful of the warm stock to the rice. Stir constantly until the liquid is almost completely absorbed.\n\n7. Continue adding stock, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. This process takes about 18-20 minutes.\n\n8. After about 15 minutes, add the reserved porcini liquid.\n\n9. Test the rice regularly towards the end of cooking. It should be creamy but still have a slight bite to it (al dente).\n\n10. Once the rice is cooked, remove from heat. Stir in the remaining butter, Parmesan cheese, and the reserved cooked mushrooms.\n\n11. Cover and let rest for 2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n\n12. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan cheese if desired.",
      "notes": "The key to perfect risotto is adding the stock gradually and stirring frequently to release the rice's starch for a creamy texture. Don't rush the process. For a vegan version, use olive oil instead of butter and nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan. For an elevated presentation, add a drizzle of truffle oil just before serving.",
