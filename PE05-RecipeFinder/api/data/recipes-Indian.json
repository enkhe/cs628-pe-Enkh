      "instructions": "1. Wash the basmati rice until the water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes, then drain.\n\n2. In a bowl, mix chicken with yogurt, half of the garlic and ginger pastes, turmeric, red chili powder, 1 tsp garam masala, ground coriander, ground cumin, and salt. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n\n3. Soak saffron threads in warm milk and set aside.\n\n4. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat half of the ghee or oil. Fry two of the sliced onions until golden brown and crispy, about 10-12 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside for garnish.\n\n5. In the same pot, add the whole spices and remaining onion. Sauté until onions are translucent.\n\n6. Add remaining garlic and ginger pastes, green chilies, and tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes break down and oil begins to separate, about 5-6 minutes.\n\n7. Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes until chicken is nearly cooked through.\n\n8. In a separate large pot, bring water to a boil with salt. Add the drained rice and cook until it's 70% done (about 5-6 minutes). Drain the rice.\n\n9. Layer half of the par-cooked rice over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle with half of the mint, cilantro, and remaining garam masala. Layer the remaining rice on top.\n\n10. Pour the saffron milk over the rice. Dot with remaining ghee or oil.\n\n11. Cover tightly with foil, then place the lid on top. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes.\n\n12. Remove from heat and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.\n\n13. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers. Top with the fried onions.\n\n14. Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and lemon wedges.",
      "notes": "For the best flavor, don't rush the process. The slow cooking allows all the spices to meld. If you prefer boneless chicken, reduce the cooking time accordingly. The layering technique (known as 'dum' cooking) is what gives biryani its distinctive flavor profile. Be careful when fluffing not to break the rice grains too much.",

      "notes": "For a spicier curry, add a finely chopped green chili with the garlic and ginger. For a creamier texture, use full-fat coconut milk. This curry tastes even better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld.",
