      "instructions": "1. Soak rice noodles in hot water according to package instructions until they're pliable but still firm. Drain and set aside.\n\n2. In a small bowl, mix fish sauce, tamarind paste, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and sriracha sauce to make the pad thai sauce. Set aside.\n\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat. Add chicken and shrimp (if using) and stir-fry until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from wok and set aside.\n\n4. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok. Add beaten eggs and scramble until just set, about 30 seconds. Remove and set aside.\n\n5. Add remaining oil to the wok. Add garlic and shallot, stir-frying until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tofu and stir-fry for another minute.\n\n6. Add the softened noodles to the wok and pour the sauce over them. Toss well to coat, and stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until the noodles start to caramelize and absorb the sauce.\n\n7. Return the cooked chicken, shrimp, and eggs to the wok. Add half of the bean sprouts and half of the green onions. Toss everything together for another minute.\n\n8. Transfer to serving plates and garnish with remaining bean sprouts, green onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side.",
      "notes": "Authentic pad thai uses tamarind paste for its distinctive sour flavor, but if you can't find it, you can substitute with more lime juice and a touch of brown sugar. Have all ingredients prepped and ready before you start cooking, as this dish comes together quickly. For a vegetarian version, omit the meat and use more tofu, plus substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce.",

      "instructions": "1. Remove the shells and heads from the shrimp, reserving them. Devein shrimp and set aside.\n\n2.

Bring the strained broth back to a simmer. Add mushrooms and tomatoes, cooking for about 5 minutes.\n\n6. Add the shrimp and cook just until they turn pink, about 2 minutes.\n\n7. Turn off the heat. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, chili paste, and sugar. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.\n\n8. Serve hot, garnished with cilantro, green onions, and additional fresh Thai chilies if desired.",
      "notes": "Tom Yum Goong is a classic hot and sour Thai soup. For a creamier version (Tom Yum Nam Khon), add 1/2 cup of coconut milk at the end. If you can't find kaffir lime leaves, substitute with lime zest. Adjust the number of chilies depending on your spice tolerance. The soup should have a balance of hot, sour, and savory flavors. It's traditionally served with steamed jasmine rice.",
